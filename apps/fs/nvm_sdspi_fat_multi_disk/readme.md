# FAT file system using NVM and SDSPI media

This application shows an example of using the FAT File System to access files across multiple media (NVM, SDSPI).

## Description

### File System Operations on NVM and SD Card:

- The application contains a FAT disk image consisting of a Master Boot Record (MBR) sector, Logical Boot Sector, File Allocation Table, and Root Directory Area, placed in the internal Flash memory (NVM)
- A SD card is used as another disk, which might have FAT16 or FAT32 implemented on it (dependent on the formatting of SD card)
- The application searches the NVM media for a named **FILE.TXT**, opens and reads the contents of the file in NVM and copies the contents to the file, **FILE.TXT**, in the SD card
- Once the copy is successful, an addition string **"Test is successful"** is added to the file. If the write operation is successful, LED indication is provided

### File system layer uses:

- Memory driver to communicate with underlying NVM media
- SDSPI Driver to communicate to SD Card over SPI

### Setting up [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)

- To run this demo, following additional hardware is required:
  - [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
  - micro-SD card formatted to FAT filesystem

- Connect [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO) to the EXT1 connector
- Insert the micro-SD Card in the micro-SD Card slot of the [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON when the content from the NVM media is copied to SD-Card successfully

    Refer to the following table for LED name:

    | Board | LED Name |
    | ----- | -------- |
    |  [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113) | LED1 |
    |||

3. If Success, Insert the SD Card on to your host PC
4. FILE.txt should have the content "This data from NVM Disk Test is successful"
