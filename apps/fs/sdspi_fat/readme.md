# FAT filesystem using SDSPI media

This application shows an example of using the FAT File System to access and modify the contents of a SD card using the SDSPI driver and the SPI PLIB.

## Description

### File System Operations on the SD Card

- The application opens a file named **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** on the SD card
- Reads the content of the file and creates a directory named **Dir1**
- Inside the directory, writes the copied content into another file **Dir1/FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG**

The image file could be any arbitrary JPEG (image) file chosen by the user and then renamed to** FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG**.The reason for choosing a JPEG file for test purposes is that the duplicate file, **Dir1/FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** created by the demonstration could be easily verified for correctness.

If the new file inside **Dir1** opens for viewing on the computer and matches to original image, the test is deemed to have passed. Otherwise, if the file does not open (i.e., is corrupted), the test will be considered to have failed.

**Note:** *Since the application creates a directory named **Dir1**, it is important that the a folder with the same name does not exist on the SD card. If a directory named **Dir1** is already present on the SD card, the application will fail.*

### File system layer uses:

SDSPI Driver to communicate to SD Card over SPI interface.

### Setting up [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
  - Micro-SD card formatted to FAT filesystem
  - Copy a JPG file named **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** on the SD card
- Connect the [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO) to the EXT1 header
- Insert microSD card on the [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. Press the switch to start the application
3. The LED is turned ON if there was no error during creating the directory and copying the file into it

    Refer to the following table for LED name:

    | Board | LED Name | Switch Name |
    | ----- | -------- | ----------- |
    |  [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113) | LED1 | SW0 |
    ||||

4. If LED is ON, Insert the SD Card on to your host PC
5. SD Card should have the file **Dir1/FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** and should match the original image
