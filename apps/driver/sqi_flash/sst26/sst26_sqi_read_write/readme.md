# SST26 SQI flash driver - Flash read write in Quad IO mode

This example application shows how to use the SST26 SQI flash driver to perform block operations on the On-Board SST26 Flash memory in Quad IO mode.

## Description

This application uses the SST26 driver to Erase/Write/Read on the On-Board SST26 Flash memory using the QSPI or SQI peripheral library in Quad IO mode.

The application consists of APP_SST26_Tasks() which is called through SYS_Tasks() routine.
