# Memory driver asynchronous - NVM SST26 Read Write

This example application shows how to use the Memory driver in asynchronous mode to perform block operations on the NVM and the SST26 media's.

## Description

### This application:

- Uses multi instances of the Memory driver to communicate with the NVM and the SST26 Flash memories in asynchronous mode of operation in Bare-Metal environment

- Performs block Erase/Write/Read operations on both the media's

- Consists of five tasks which are called through the SYS_Tasks() routine in Bare-Metal environment

    1. **DRV_MEMORY_0_Tasks():**
        - Manages the state machine of the Memory driver instance 0
    2. **DRV_MEMORY_1_Tasks():**
        - Manages the state machine of the Memory driver instance 1
    3. **APP_SST26_Tasks():**
        - Performs operations on the SST26 QSPI/SQI Flash memory
    4. **APP_NVM_Tasks():**
        - Performs operations on the NVM
    5. **APP_MONITOR_Tasks():**
        - Monitors the state of above two Tasks
