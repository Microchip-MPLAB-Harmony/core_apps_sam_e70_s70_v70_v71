# I2C driver synchronous - I2C EEPROM

This example application shows how to use the I2C driver in synchronous mode to perform operations on the EEPROM.

## Description

This example uses the I2C driver in synchronous mode to communicate with the EEPROM to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment. This application uses I2C driver to read and write data from an on-Board AT24MAC402 EEPROM device.
