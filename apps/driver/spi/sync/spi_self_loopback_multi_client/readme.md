# SPI Driver synchronous - Self loopback multi client

This example demonstrates how to use the SPI driver in synchronous mode to achieve self-loop back between multiple clients in RTOS environment.

## Description

This example writes and reads back the same data (self loop back) for two different clients connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of a synchronous SPI driver. The example also demonstrates how to setup two different client transfers at two different baud rates.

The example has three RTOS threads for the purpose:

- **APP_CLIENT1_Tasks**: This thread opens the SPI driver instance and performs a continuous loop back transfer. If the loop back is successful, the loop back is repeated every 100 ms. In case of an error, the thread closes the driver and suspends itself.
- **APP_CLIENT2_Tasks**: This thread opens the SPI driver instance and performs a continuous loop back transfer. If the loop back is successful, the loop back is repeated every 100 ms. In case of an error, the thread closes the driver and suspends itself.
- **APP_MONITOR_Tasks**: This thread checks the status of loop back done by the two client tasks and turns on the LED if the loop back transfer status reported by both the clients is successful.

### Setting up [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)

- Use jumper wire to Connect "Pin 16 of EXT1 header" to "Pin 17 of EXT1 header"
  - SPI0 MOSI signal is mapped to PD21 that is routed to "Pin 16 of EXT1 header"
  - SPI0 MISO signal is mapped to PD20 that is routed to "Pin 17 of EXT1 header"
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
