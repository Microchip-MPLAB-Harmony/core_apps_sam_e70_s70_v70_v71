# SPI Driver asynchronous - Self loopback multi client

This example demonstrates how to use the SPI driver in asynchronous mode to achieve self-loop back between multiple clients.

## Description

- This example writes and reads back the same data (self loop back) for two different clients connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of the driver

- It uses the request (write and read request) queuing feature of the asynchronous driver and does not waste CPU bandwidth in waiting for previous request completion

- The example also demonstrates how to setup two different client transfers at different baud rates

- This example performs self loop back only once after a power on reset
- Success is indicated when a successful self loop back is reported by both the clients
- After the loop back test is complete, the application remains in the idle state
