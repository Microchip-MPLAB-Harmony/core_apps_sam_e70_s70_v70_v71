# SPI Driver asynchronous - multi slave

This example demonstrates how to use single instance of the SPI driver in asynchronous mode to communicate with multiple EEPROMs.

## Description

This example write and read data to and from two separate EEPROM connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of the driver.The example also demonstrates how to setup two different EEPROM transfers at different baud rates.

- Connect the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro boards](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) on EXT1 and EXT2 headers
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED indicates success or failure
    - The LED turns ON when the data read from the EEPROMs matches with the data written to the EEPROMs.

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113) | LED2 |
|  [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamv71-xult) | LED0 |
