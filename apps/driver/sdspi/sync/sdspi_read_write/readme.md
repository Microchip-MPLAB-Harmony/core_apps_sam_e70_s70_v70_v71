# SDSPI driver synchronous - SDSPI Read Write

This example application shows how to use the SDSPI driver in synchronous mode to perform block operations on the SD Card Media.

## Description

- The synchronous mode of the SDSPI driver is configured to use DMA and performs blocking read and write operations

- This example uses the SDSPI driver in synchronous mode in an RTOS environment

- A separate RTOS thread is created by the MHC to run the SDSPI task routine. This task routine checks for the SD-Card attach/detach status and initializes the SD-Card making it ready for the application to submit read and write requests

- This application writes 10KB (10240 bytes) of data starting at the SD Card memory location 0x2000
- The application then reads and verifies the written data

### Setting up [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
  - Micro-SD card

- Connect the [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO) to the EXT1 header
- Insert microSD card on the [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON when the read data from the SD card matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:
